You will need to install Node.js for development. The best way to install
Node.js is with [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):

  (_IMPORTANT:_ [run installer as Administrator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50563188/access-denied-issue-with-nvm-in-windows-10))

Once you have installed NVM, open a terminal and run:

```bash
nvm install 22 && corepack enable
pnpm install
